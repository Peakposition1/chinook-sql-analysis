# Chinook Sales Analysis using Python and SQL

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis using Python and SQL on the Chinook SQLite database.
The analysis focuses on customer distribution, revenue insights, and identifying top customers.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer distribution across countries
- Identify top revenue-generating customers
- Practice SQL queries inside Python
- Visualize insights using Python

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- SQLite
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- DB Browser for SQLite
- JupyterLab
- GitHub

## Dataset
The Chinook database is a sample SQLite database representing a digital music store.
It includes customers, invoices, and sales data.

Note: Row numbers shown in tables are internal SQLite indices and not business identifiers.

## Analysis & Insights

### Customers by Country
- **Insight:** The United States has the highest number of customers, followed by Canada and Germany.
- **Recommendation:** Focus marketing efforts on top-performing countries while exploring growth opportunities in countries with fewer customers.

### Top 10 Customers by Total Spending
- **Insight:** A small group of customers contributes a significant portion of total revenue.
- **Recommendation:** Introduce loyalty programs or personalized promotions for high-value customers to improve retention.

## Visualizations
Bar charts were created using Matplotlib to clearly present:
- Customer distribution by country
- Top customers by total spending

## Repository Structure
- `chinook.db` – SQLite database file
- `queries.sql` – SQL queries used in analysis
- `Chinook_SQL_Analysis.ipynb` – Python notebook with SQL queries and visualizations
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Key Takeaways
- SQL and Python can be combined to analyze real-world databases.
- Data visualization helps communicate insights effectively.
- Business recommendations can be derived from simple analyses.
